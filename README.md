I'm thrilled to share my latest project with you all - a YouTube clone that I've built from the ground up!

With over 2 billion monthly active users, YouTube has become an essential part of our digital lives.
Here are just a few of the exciting features that you'll find on my YouTube clone:

- A powerful search function that makes it easy to find the content you're looking for using debouncing and caching the result in redux store to improve search performance.
- Live chat feature with dummy data using api polling.
- n - Level nested comments with dummy data.
- dark theme
- skeleton screen

Here's a quick rundown of the tech stack I used to create my YouTube clone:
- React.js for the frontend - this powerful JavaScript library allowed me to create a fast and responsive user interface with ease
- react-router-dom - this powerful library enables the creation of single page application that allows navigation without refreshing the page.
- tailwindcss - utility-first CSS framework Tailwind CSS to create a highly customizable and responsive user interface.
- react redux - for state management
